## Features

 * Wipes content older than given days, 15 by default.
 * Special handling for "dependant" entity types (comment, paragraph):
 For better consistency, instead of deleting older ones, it deletes the orphaned ones,
 after wiping parent entity types.
 * Wipes all entity tables (base fields, fields and revisions).
 * In simulation mode (`-s`) it prints the queries to run.
 * Hookable so you can extend the base functionality. See `shrinkdb.api.php`.
 * Leverages the great [drush_entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/drush_entity).

```
$ drush help shrinkdb

Shrink the database size by wiping content older than given days.

Options:
 --days=<15>                               Age (in days) of the contents to preserve. 15 by default.
```


```
$ drush shrinkdb
Do you really want to wipe content older than 15 days in the current database? (y/n): y
```


```
$ drush help sql-sanitize

Run sanitization operations on the current database. You can add more sanitization to this command by implementing hook_drush_sql_sync_sanitize().

Options:
 --db-prefix                                Enable replacement of braces in sanitize queries.
 --db-url=<mysql://root:pass@127.0.0.1/db>  A Drupal 6 style database URL.
 --sanitize-email=<user+%uid@localhost>     The pattern for test email addresses in the sanitization operation, or "no" to keep email addresses unchanged.  May contain replacement patterns %uid, %mail or %name.
 --sanitize-password=<password>             The password to assign to all accounts in the sanitization operation, or "no" to keep passwords unchanged.
 --shrink-db                                Shrink the database size by wiping content older than given days.
 --shrink-db-days=<15>                      Age (in days) of the contents to preserve. 15 by default.
```


```
$ drush @site sql-sanitize --shrink-db

The following operations will be done on the target database:
 * Wipe content older than 15 days
 * Reset passwords and email addresses in users_field_data table
 * Truncate Drupal's sessions table
```
